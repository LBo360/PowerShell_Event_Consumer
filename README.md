## Description
Repository to store working examples created for WMI/CIM Consumers

## Usage
Currently each script monitors EventCreation for "Calculator.exe". Once triggered,code is executed to kill the process. In its current state it is nothing more than
a cheap joke, but this example is unique and highlights the incredible flexibility and power of Event Consumers. 

## Credits
These examples wouldnt be possible without the work of [Boe Prox](https://learn-powershell.net/2013/08/14/powershell-and-events-permanent-wmi-event-subscriptions/) and [Faris Malaeb](https://adamtheautomator.com/your-goto-guide-for-working-with-windows-wmi-events-and-powershell/#Binding_the_Event_Filter_and_Consumer_Together) and their fantastic research and great documentation.
